## Summary

Day | Puzzle Name     | Status | Remarks |
---    |---           |---     |---    |
01     | Sonar Sweep  | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | I miss statically typed languages. ‚òπÔ∏è
02     | Dive!        | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | I decided to solve today's puzzle before getting out of bed in the morning. Mobile python development in an online IDE is possible, but not enjoyable. 
03     | Binary Diagnostic | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | I did the binary to decimal conversion manually in the code.  I should research math libraries!<Br/>TIL: the '^' symbol is an xor and '\*\*' is used to rase a number to a power
04     | Giant Squid | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Reading the requirements is important!  I made it extra complicated for *fun*. üòÜ 
05     | Hydrothermal Venture | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | TIL: that the range method does not include the stop value. 
06     | Lanternfish | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | I did this in a browser based python editor again.  I had to laugh when it killed my process because it used too much memory for part 2
07     | The Treachery of Whales | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | I spent *way* too much time trying to decide the best mathmatical way to calculate this 
08     | Seven Segment Search | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | This was a fun logic puzzle
09     | Smoke Basin | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | I struggled with part 2 today. That could be because I skimmed the instructions üòÑ
10     | Syntax Scoring | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | I loved this one, but it's also something I've reasoned through before when providing a custom query builder at work
11     | Dumbo Octopus | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | The work I did in part 1 helped me in part 2
12     | Passage Pathing |     | I skipped this for now
13     | Transparent Origami | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | I'm running out of interesting comments
