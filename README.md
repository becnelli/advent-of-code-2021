## Summary

Day | Puzzle Name     | Status | Remarks |
---    |---           |---     |---    |
01     | Sonar Sweep  | ⭐⭐ | I miss statically typed languages. ☹️
02     | Dive!        | ⭐⭐ | I decided to solve today's puzzle before getting out of bed in the morning. Mobile python development in an online IDE is possible, but not enjoyable. 
03     | Binary Diagnostic | ⭐⭐ | I did the binary to decimal conversion manually in the code.  I should research math libraries!<Br/>TIL: the '^' symbol is an xor and '\*\*' is used to rase a number to a power
04     | Giant Squid | ⭐⭐ | Reading the requirements is important!  I made it extra complicated for *fun*. 😆 
05     | Hydrothermal Venture | ⭐⭐ | TIL: that the range method does not include the stop value. 
06     | Lanternfish | ⭐⭐ | I did this in a browser based python editor again.  I had to laugh when it killed my process because it used too much memory for part 2
07     | The Treachery of Whales | ⭐⭐ | I spent *way* too much time trying to decide the best mathmatical way to calculate this 
08     | Seven Segment Search | ⭐ | This is a work in progress - I need to work at work first
